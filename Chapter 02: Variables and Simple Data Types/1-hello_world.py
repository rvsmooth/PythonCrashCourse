#You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time, 
#and Python will always keep track of its current value.

# RULES FOR DEFINING VARIABLES 
#
# A. VARIABLE NAMES CAN CONTAIN ONLY - 1.LETTERS, 2.NUMBERS and 3.UNDERSCORES. 
#       THEY CAN START WITH - 1. LETTERS or 2. UNDERSCORES 
#       THEY CANNOT START WITH - A NUMBER
#       eg: message_1 is valid however 1_message is invalid
#       
# B.    SPACES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN VAIABLE NAMES; USE UNDERSCORES INSTEAD
#
